# Backend for Project Website


## Public REST Endpoints

You can access the public [REST endpoint](https://backend-projects-8pai.onrender.com)
or the
[Postman-Collection](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/13617236/2sA35A8kXu)

Visit [<backend-URL>/init](https://backend-projects-8pai.onrender.com/init) to fill the database. 

Please note that this project uses the free instance of [Render](https://render.com/) for Backend and Database. There might be delays due to inactivity-induced instance spin-down. Keep this in mind when accessing the deployed application. It's recommended to [trigger](https://backend-projects-8pai.onrender.com)  the Backend before using the frontend.
